    "questions": {
      "whatIs": {
        "question": "What is a \"Cloud PC\"?",
        "answer": "A cloud computer is a virtual machine, accessed remotely from your device, without regional limitations, offering accessibility and comfort, with all the services and functionalities of a normal computer, but without the need to have the physical product in hand."
      },
      "canUpdate": {
        "question": "Can I update the system?",
        "answer": "No, all system components including drivers were designed for the best performance of your machine, changing these settings can decrease performance and even break the machine, and it is considered misuse of our services."
      },
      "howWorks": {
        "question": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "Our system allows you to connect your device directly to a computer on our server, this computer is designed to offer the best performance for your activities, such as games, work, and much more."
      },
      "mobileSupport": {
        "question": "Does it work on Android and iOS?",
        "answer": "Yes, on Android the first access can be made through RDP or VNC and then move on to using Moonlight or Parsec. On iOS, the first access also occurs through Remote Desktop or VNC, but you cannot use Moonlight and Parsec, the only compatible streaming application for iOS is Steam Link."
      },
      "rdpGaming": {
        "question": "Can I play through RDP or VNC?",
        "answer": "No, RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) are used only for first access, allowing you to link your Parsec, Moonlight, and Steam Link accounts. After linking your accounts, you should close RDP or VNC and play exclusively through Parsec, Moonlight, or Steam Link."
      },
      "whyUse": {
        "question": "Why use a cloud PC?",
        "answer": "The expenses to have a physical computer like those from Space Cloud would be close to R$12,000, not counting maintenance costs that will come with time of use, that's why a cloud computer is much more cost-effective."
      },
      "spotMachine": {
        "question": "What is a Spot Machine?",
        "answer": "Spot Machines are a more affordable variant of standard VMs. This is because these instances can be interrupted by the Compute Engine to recover computing capacity to direct them to other VMs."
      },
      "fileSaving": {
        "question": "Do I lose my files when turning off the machine?",
        "answer": "No, our services include 100% secure file saving, just allocate these files and documents to one of the machine's hard drives, so your game files, work documents, and projects are not lost when shutting down or restarting your machine."
      },
      "loginQueue": {
        "question": "Is there a login queue system?",
        "answer": "No, to make your experience more comfortable we work without waiting queues, so you can access your machine whenever and wherever you want without taking too much of your time just for a login."
